# Delaunay Simulation in 2D

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the simulation and visualization of **Delaunay triangulation** in 2D space. Delaunay triangulation is a fundamental structure in computational geometry with applications in mesh generation, computer graphics, interpolation, and more.

## 📁 File Included

- `DelaunaySimulation (2).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the Delaunay triangulation, including visualization and step-by-step simulation.

## 🚀 Features

- Generate random 2D points.
- Compute and visualize the Delaunay triangulation.
- Optionally animate the triangulation process.
- Useful for educational and research purposes.

## 🧠 Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
